Subject: [PATCH 148/432] Increase firmware call buffer size to 48 bytes

An assumption was made in commit a1547e0bc that 32 bytes
would be enough data buffer size for all firmware calls. However,
the axi performance monitor driver uses a call with 44 bytes
(RPI_FIRMWARE_GET_PERIPH_REG) to get the VC registers values.

Increase value to 48 to take this in to account.
